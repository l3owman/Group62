# Group62

#We got the folders set up, more can be added if needed.

#Click projects to see the current to do list. Feel free to add any. When you start one of the cards make sure to drag it over to the "in progress" section so we know it's in development. If you need any help add a new card to the to do list so others can see what needs to happen.

#The linux server is set up with a dummy site, see the link below. This will be used to display our website.
